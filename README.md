# The_Blog

The Blog is a responsive site that allows users to create and manage blog posts and add comments to these posts as either a guest, an admin/blogging user, or general/commenting user. Additionally, this program allows authors to assign blog posts to specific categories, allowing users to filter blog posts to their desired topic.
